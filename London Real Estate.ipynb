    "- Apartments in the most popular London districts - Westminster, Camden, Tower Hamlets - have stable demand and pretty high rent prices\n",
    "- Real estate bought in other districts may require precise location choice and the demand may depend on the season. For instance, Southwark is not very popular during summer, and distance to The Marksman may define rent price range for your place."
