    "The average rent prices for well-prepared accomodation vary across districts. Top districts with highest average prices per accommodate for one-person and two-person apartments are listed.

Consider Tower Hamlets or Lambeth - these districts are not even in TOP-15!\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "- Apartments in the most popular London districts - Westminster and Camden - have stable demand and pretty high rent prices. That's why if you want to stay in a popular part of the city - Tower Hamlets or Lambeth may be the choice. \n",
    "- When the amount of accomodates is higher than three, the price per accommodate reduces significantly. And if you have a good company, it might be even more cheap to rent a place with shared bathrooms or bedrooms.\n",
    "- The summer is not a very cheap time to visit London. But if you really want to, Southwark may be the choice. This district is pretty expensive, but its emptiness during this season may drop the prices.\n",
    "- The apartments in several locations of London may cost much lower then the average for the related district. If you want to save your pocket - it is better to seek for accommodation in such places."
